Both of these descriptions are consistent with 11th century depictions of Fáfnir as a runic animal on various picture stones, sometimes being limbless and other times featuring various forms of limbs. Such stones are collectively called Sigurd stones, after Fáfnir\\'s killer, Sigurd, who often acts as the indicator for the motif.'"

Interestingly, the Icelandic written corpus still describe dragons as very serpentine-like. Their tail, for example, is often called a sporðr, a word for \"fish tail, serpent tail and thereof\" (a tail for swimming). The 13th century saga, Bjarnar saga Hítdœlakappa, writes the following: | Then Bjorn grabbed the dragon\\'s tail with one hand, and with the other he slashed at the wings, which broke and the dragon fell down dead. }} The later, 14th century saga, Ketils saga hœngs, specifically refers to sporðr as the tail of a serpent, and also describes the dragon as having a \"coil\" () like a serpent, but \"wings like a dragon\": | He had a coiled body and tail like a serpent, but wings like a dragon. }} The evolution of wingless and legless worms and lindworms to flying, four-legged romanesque dragons in Germanic folklore and literature is most likely due to influence from continental Europe that was facilitated by Christianisation and the increased availability of translated romances. It has thus been proposed that the description in Völuspá of Níðhöggr with feathers and flying after Ragnarök is a late addition and potentially a result of the integration of pagan and Christian imagery. Interestingly, Old Icelandic was later literarily borrowed into Old Swedish as flughdraki and floghdraki, which then became a term for a Swedish type of wingless, limbless, flying dragon – Flogdrake – said to soar across the skies as a fiery or golden stripe that stretches across the sky (compare the Swedish lindworm, which lacks both limbs and wings, also the analog Slavic fiery serpents). Old Swedish floghdraki was also, as a partial calque, borrowed into Finnish, as , \"louhi-serpent\", which later folk-etymologically morphed into (\"salmon serpent\"), Finnish for dragon.'"

In appearance, it is related to the fiery serpents of Slavic myth; it is a wingless worm-dragon that flies across the sky while glowing, looking like a streak of fire or light akin to a shooting star, but unlike Slavic myth, it lives in mountain tunnels that it bores. Related myths also exist in Northern Germany, for example the Schrat.<ref name=\"kb.dk\"/>'"

              "'Dragons have been a significant part of English folklore for centuries 🐉. In Beowulf, the dragon plays a crucial role in the story as the final monster that Beowulf faces, ultimately leading to his demise. The dragon is angered when a slave steals a cup from its treasure, leading it to attack the neighboring towns. Beowulf, despite being mortally wounded in the battle, manages to deliver the fatal blow with the help of his kinsman Wiglaf. This depiction of the dragon as a formidable and vengeful creature has influenced many modern fantasy works, with dragons being portrayed as both villainous and benign characters 🐲. The Beowulf dragon is considered one of the first fire-breathing dragons in European mythology, setting the stage for the dragons we see in modern fantasy literature 📚.'"
